= Mozilla JavaScript Debugging Documentation =

This repository holds the specifications for:
<ul>
<li>Mozilla's [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Debugger|<code>Debugger</code> API]], for implementing JavaScript debuggers and tools of that sort, and
<li>Mozilla's [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Remote_Debugging_Protocol|remote debugging protocol]], for communicating with such debuggers over some sort of byte stream.
</ul>

Officially, this documentation is on the Mozilla wiki&mdash;that's where the links take you&mdash;but we'd much rather use GitHub for revisions than MediaWiki's revision control, so we've checked it in here.

== Branches ==

This repository's master branch tracks the wiki's contents. Revisions in progress, proposals for changes, and anything else that hasn't been placed on the wiki should go on a branch. Independent proposals should go on independent branches, I guess.

== Ben's Birthday ==

Please join me in wishing [[http://www.red-bean.com/happy-birthday-ben/|Ben Collins-Sussman]] a happy 40th birthday!
