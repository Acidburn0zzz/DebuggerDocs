= Mozilla JavaScript Debugging Documentation =

This is the specification for Mozilla's <code>Debugger</code> API, for implementing JavaScript debuggers and tools of that sort. Officially, this documentation is on the [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Debugger|Mozilla wiki]], but we'd much rather use GitHub for revisions than MediaWiki's revision control, so we've checked it in here.

We'll soon bring in the remote debugging protocol docs in here as well.

== Branches ==

This repository's master branch tracks the wiki's contents. Revisions in progress, proposals for changes, and anything else that hasn't been placed on the wiki should go on a branch.
